The documents type should be specified. to create the webpage
One of the many things we do is to tell the type of document. 
there are numerous one but for now lets stick to <!DOCTYPE html>
Note the opening and closing tags.
the html element is everything from the start tag to the end tag.
some elements have no content like the <br> element . it has no closing tag
because it is an empty element.and hence no end tag.
the purpose of a web browser is to read html documents and display them correctly.
a browser does not display the HTML tags but uses them to determine.
how to display the document:
All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.

The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.

The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>

The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.

It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is:
<!DOCTYPE html>

After declaration of the doctype to enable the web browser to display the web pages
correctly?
let us learn about some ermmm tags and what they do .
so the the headings part takes the title of the documents 
and we open the headings tag with a h1 to h6 depending on order of the headings
Priority.h1 is of the highest priority and h6 is the lowest...
3. paragrahp tags ends and begins with a p.<p> everything in here is what will really show </p>
note that the paragraph always contains the points in the body...
4 <a>..HTML link : the <a> (href = link you want)  allows a creater to add a link file to a document... this is a link</a>
The link's destination is specified in the href attribute.
Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.
5. HTML Images
HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.
The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes:

The <br> element is for line break is basically like new line in python or other languages..
example <p>this is a paragraph <br> and we are spliting it <p/>

Attributes:
they are always specified in the start tag and they provide additional information
about the Elements

with what we have learnt so far we have knowledge about links,images and texts 
with links we can use the attribute href to specify the link
``with images we have 4 attibutes so far 
1. src which selects the right image with the file extention attached
so from <img src = "Name of picture.extention">
we can use a relative path which would be owned and directly linked to the website
or use a link take the user to another site or sth 
the best practice is to use the relative path which is owned by the doman and 
woudnt change if the domain change

alt = Adds a discription of the image to the element. should tell what the image is at least about
width and height can speak for themselves as they deal in the appearance of the image


Stylling
the styling is used to add styles to an element such as color ,font,size and more

### adding the language of the website to the root element to declare the language of the 
webpage .this is meant to assist search engines and browsers

the title attribute defines some extra information about an element
for example houving over an element with the title attribute will give you some information
about it

Headings 
there are 6 different types as already stated
note!!! do not use headings to make text bolder or bigger 
only use headings for headings 
now by default html has its own default size for headings depending on the type u specify 
however your own style of heading together with the font size can be specified
example <h1 style ="font-size:60;"> Heading 1 </h1>


Paragraphs
a paragraph often stats on a new line and is usually a block of text.

the browser puts the code in a great form irrespective of how shitty it was written with bad
spaces and multilines
again an attribute hr -- horizontal rulings can be used to specify the different paragrahs we are working with

Boders,padding and margins
boders encircles an html element 
paddind defines the space between the text the border whilst margin deals with the space outside the border











the 16 characters used are the letter (a-f) and the number (0-9)
(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d,e,f)
